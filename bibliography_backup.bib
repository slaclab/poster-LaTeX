% abstract = {Quantum computers may revolutionize the field of computation by solving some complex problems that are intractable even for the most powerful current supercomputers. This paper first introduces the basic concepts of quantum computing and describes what the required layers are for building a quantum system. Thereafter, it discusses the different engineering challenges when building a quantum computer ranging from the core qubit technology, the control electronics, to the microarchitecture for the execution of quantum circuits and efficient quantum error correction. We conclude by discussing some compiler and programming issues relative to quantum algorithms.},

abstract = {Quantum dots, or artificial atoms, are being pursued as prospective building blocks for quantum information processing architectures. Communication with other, distant quantum dots requires strong coupling between photons and the electronic states of the dots. Mi et al. used double quantum dots defined in silicon and embedded in a superconducting cavity to achieve such coupling. This demonstration in an industry-relevant material bodes well for the large-scale development of semiconductor-based quantum processors. Science, this issue p. 156 Strong coupling can be achieved between a microwave cavity photon and a single electron in a silicon quantum dot. Silicon is vital to the computing industry because of the high quality of its native oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification has enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing silicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid-state quantum processor. We demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum dot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of vacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity photon would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range entanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.}

abstract = {To help develop quantum circuits, much effort has been directed toward achieving the strong-coupling regime by using gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots. Potentially, the magnetic dipole, or spin, of a single electron for use as a qubit has advantages over charge-photon coupling owing to its longer lifetime. Samkharadze et al. hybridized the electron spin with the electron charge in a double silicon quantum dot. This approach yielded strong coupling between the single electron spin and a single microwave photon, providing a route to scalable quantum circuits with spin qubits. Science, this issue p. 1123 Strong coupling is induced between a single electron spin and a single photon. Long coherence times of single spins in silicon quantum dots make these systems highly attractive for quantum computation, but how to scale up spin qubit systems remains an open question. As a first step to address this issue, we demonstrate the strong coupling of a single electron spin and a single microwave photon. The electron spin is trapped in a silicon double quantum dot, and the microwave photon is stored in an on-chip high-impedance superconducting resonator. The electric field component of the cavity photon couples directly to the charge dipole of the electron in the double dot, and indirectly to the electron spin, through a strong local magnetic field gradient from a nearby micromagnet. Our results provide a route to realizing large networks of quantum dot–based spin qubit registers.}
